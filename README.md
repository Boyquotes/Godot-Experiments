# 🕹️ Godot Experiments

This repository will contain various small game prototypes, intended to help me learn and experiment with Godot 4 and GDScript. Each folder will represent a different prototype, designed to explore specific genres.

## 🎮 Planned Projects

- 🚀 Platformer - A simple platformer game (in progress).

## 📚 Getting Started

To run any of the prototypes, once available, follow these steps:

1. Install [Godot 4](https://godotengine.org/download) if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Godot-Experiments.git`
3. Open the Godot Project Manager and click on the "Import" button.
4. Navigate to the folder of the prototype you want to try (e.g., `Godot-Experiments/Platformer`), and select the `project.godot` file.
5. Click "Import & Edit" to open the project in the Godot editor.
6. Press F5 to run the prototype.
